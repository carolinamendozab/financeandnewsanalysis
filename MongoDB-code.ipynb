If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Warren Buffett\\'s Stock Portfolio and 5 Newest Investments in 2022.\\n\\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway acquiring a $4.1 billion stake in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) during the third quarter of 2022 has made headlines since the latest securities filings were disclosed. Wall Street is taking Buffett’s new stock investment as an indication that the semiconductor stocks might be due for a rebound soon.\\n\\nOn November 15, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares climbed more than 12% to $81.62 in mid-day trading as Buffett disclosed his stake, while other chip makers also rose, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL). These firms are also TSMC’s customers.\\n\\nIn recent years, Warren Buffett has been willing to invest in technology, with the Berkshire portfolio featuring notable stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ). Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones, noted that tech and communications businesses now represent approximately half of Berkshire’s portfolio, which he said provides a good balance as the firm’s “portfolio companies are more old economy”.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWe selected the 10 stocks which were either new additions to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, or where the fund increased its holdings during the end of the third quarter of 2022, for this analysis. Two of these ten stocks were added to the Berkshire holdings in the last two years. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities.\\n\\nStory continues Warren Buffett\\'s Stock Portfolio and 10 Newest Investments in 2022\\n\\nWarren Buffett\\'s Stock Portfolio and Newest Investments in 2022\\n\\n10. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $12,790,000\\n\\nJefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is a New York-based company that engages in investment banking, capital markets, and asset management businesses in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The company operates through Investment Banking and Capital Markets, Asset Management, Merchant Banking, and Corporate segments. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway added Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) to its Q3 2022 portfolio by purchasing 433,558 shares worth $12.8 million.\\n\\nOn September 28, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) declared a $0.30 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 29, to shareholders of record on November 14. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF)’s dividend yield on November 18 came in at 3.22%.\\n\\nKeefe Bruyette analyst Michael Brown on September 5 upgraded Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $38, up from $30. The analyst said Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is an attractive way to play an investment banking recovery \"with idiosyncratic catalysts and limited downside.\"\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 33 hedge funds were bullish on Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter. Robert Rodriguez and Steven Romick’s First Pacific Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5.7 million shares worth $169.5 million.\\n\\nLike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) is also backed by Warren Buffett.\\n\\nHere is what GoodHaven Capital Management specifically said about Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:JEF) was our next biggest dollar detractor, and had also been a strong contributor in prior periods. As we have previously mentioned, while Jefferies has become a better business it is still a cyclical business, and that some moderating earnings after the recent boom were to be expected. In the first six months of their fiscal 2022, Jefferies earned a ROATE (Return on Adjusted Tangible Equity) of over 11%, reasonable given the very material slowdown in the capital markets lately. They also repurchased over $620 million of their shares at $34+ per share and Jefferies’ stock now trades below tangible book value/share. Given the obvious slowdown in capital raising transactions industry wide, we expect continued muted results in the near-term but also continued share buybacks. Our long-term enthusiasm remains, as does our view of the material upside for the shares from recent levels.”\\n\\n9. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $296,692,000\\n\\nLouisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) is an American company that manufactures and markets building products primarily for use in new home construction, repair and remodeling, and outdoor structure markets. Warren Buffett added Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) to his Q3 portfolio by purchasing 5.8 million shares worth about $297 million, representing 0.10% of the total holdings.\\n\\nOn October 28, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) declared a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 1, to shareholders of record on November 9. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)’s dividend yield on November 18 came in at 1.44%.\\n\\nBofA analyst George Staphos on September 20 downgraded Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) to Underperform from Neutral, trimming the price target to $56 from $64. The analyst lowered operating rate and pricing forecasts across primary wood products to reflect BofA\\'s housing and building product views. He believes Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) shares will have a hard time outperforming given a tough macro and a \"looming recession.\"\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) at the end of September 2022, with collective stakes worth $514.2 million, compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter worth $213.3 million. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 953,400 shares worth $48.80 million.\\n\\nHere is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“We have invested in Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) due to its Smartside siding business. Smartside has consistently increased its share of the siding market in the U.S., not just new residential construction but repair and renovation, shed and other markets. Louisiana Pacific has not been able to keep up with demand for Smartside and is sold out to the end of 2022. New capacity is being added currently which will support future growth.\\n\\nBetween 2015 to 2022, Smartside EBITDA increased from around US$100 million to a run-rate approaching US$400 million. We believe Smartside has many years of strongly profitable growth to come (see Figure 12).\\n\\nImagine being offered to buy a business. This business is breakeven in a down year, makes an operating profit of a few hundred million dollars in a normal year, and in an exceptional period in 2021 made around US$1.5 billion profit. The person offers to sell you the business for nothing. This is the current investment opportunity for Louisiana Pacific. In addition to owning Smartside, it also owns the second largest oriented strand board business in North America and a successful woods product business in South America. The price of OSB is exceptionally volatile, but has recently delivered super-normal profits to Louisiana Pacific, enabling management to buy back 45% of shares on issue while maintaining net cash. At Louisiana Pacific’s current share price, we are paying the bottom end of fair value for Smartside and getting the OSB business practically for nothing.”\\n\\n8. RH (NYSE:RH)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $580,724,000\\n\\nRH (NYSE:RH) is a California-based retailer of home furnishings, providing furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, and home decor. In Q3 2022, Warren Buffett strengthened his hold on RH (NYSE:RH) by 9%. The hedge fund had 2.36 million shares of RH (NYSE:RH) worth $580.7 million at the end of September, representing 0.19% of the total 13F securities. Buffett has held a position in RH (NYSE:RH) since the third quarter of 2019.\\n\\nOn November 18, Wedbush analyst Seth Basham downgraded RH (NYSE:RH) to Neutral from Outperform but trimmed the price target to $270 from $274. RH (NYSE:RH) has been successful in safeguarding its brand without discounting, but this has contributed to higher market share losses, the analyst wrote in a research note. He sees increasing evidence of a course-correction to its strategy of \"climbing the luxury mountain.\" The analyst, however, \"surprisingly found\" that RH (NYSE:RH) slashed prices by 2%-9% since March on half of the products. This \"potential course-correction\" in the company\\'s strategy and the worsening macro outlook led to the downgrade.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 48 funds were long RH (NYSE:RH) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 59 funds in the earlier quarter. Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital held a notable stake in the company, comprising 1.7 million shares worth $436.2 million.\\n\\nHere is what GreenWood Investors specifically said about RH (NYSE:RH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“Gary Friedman, the owner manager of RH (NYSE:RH), has been talking about the company climbing the luxury mountain over the past few years. Wall Street is skeptical RH can hold its leading margin profile after elevated demand during Covid, and it surely doubts that it is a luxury company, at 10x earnings. We’ve been looking to get involved in the housing ecosystem given the dramatic selloff in the sector over the past year, and our first investment here is via RH. Demographically, we expect US household formation to remain very strong after a decade of underinvestment in housing supply. Gary strategically with-held new product launches in the aftermath of Covid, when times were easiest, and is now releasing a new premium product lineup. We believe there is a lot of latent pricing power in home furnishing, and while high interest rates are trapping people in a home they would otherwise possibly leave, we believe the consumer, particularly the high-end consumer, will look to continue to upgrade their homes.\\n\\nThe truest test of Gary’s quest to make RH a true luxury company is in fact a recession. One of the reasons why there are few, if any, American luxury businesses, is that without a family controlling the company, optimizer-oriented management teams cannot withstand the pain that comes from not discounting a product line into weak demand. We can’t recall a single American company that has “destroyed” inventory like the French luxury companies in the face of a recession. Many have tried. Few, if any, have succeeded.\\n\\nAnchored by Gary’s 21% ownership of the company, RH has a good chance. And not only is it not tempted in the current volatile environment to discount, but he is actually raising prices. With a buyback authorized for over 30% of the shares outstanding, Friedman is also not shying away from making bold investments in the current environment. He is aggressively expanding galleries and introducing new marquee European properties. The combined product launch cadence, increased prices, aggressive footprint investments and forthcoming share repurchases, not to mention low valuation, made us move off the sidelines and take a position in RH. While we are certainly not hoping for a recession, we are excited that such an environment could solidify Gary’s mission to make RH a rare American luxury brand.”\\n\\n7. Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $834,901,000\\n\\nAlly Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is a Michigan-based digital financial services company that provides its products and services to consumer, commercial, and corporate customers in the United States and Canada. The company operates through four segments – Automotive Finance Operations, Insurance Operations, Mortgage Finance Operations, and Corporate Finance Operations.\\n\\nAlly Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) is one of the newest investments in the Berkshire portfolio. The hedge fund added Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) to its portfolio in the first quarter of 2022, and as of Q3 2022, Berkshire had 30 million shares of the company worth $835 million, representing 0.28% of the total holdings.\\n\\nOn October 26, Compass Point analyst Giuliano Bologna downgraded Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $27, down from $50, following Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY)’s Q3 earnings miss and issuance of a \"significantly weaker\" guidance for earnings through FY23.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) at the end of September 2022, and Harris Associates held a significant stake, comprising 26.7 million shares worth $745.7 million.\\n\\nHere is what Moon Capital Management specifically said about Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“We recently purchased shares of Ally Financial Inc. (NYSE:ALLY), the world’s largest digital-only bank. Ally’s legacy dates back more than 100 years when it was originally launched as GMAC, the in-house financing arm of General Motors. The company was spun out from GM and rebranded as Ally more than a decade ago, but has retained an automotive focus on the lending side, where it holds the largest position in prime auto lending.\\n\\nSince the spinoff, Ally has transformed from an auto loan company into a comprehensive, independent finance provider for borrowers and savers of all types. The company has completely restructured the liability side of its balance sheet and has created a deposit-gathering engine that is now more than 85 percent deposit[1]funded. (Compared to issuing traditional corporate debt, deposits are a significantly less expensive capital source for banks.)\\n\\nDue to the lower overhead associated with the digital bank’s lack of brick-and-mortar locations, the bank produces one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. This low-cost position, combined with a relatively high loan portfolio yield of approximately 6.75 percent, has helped the company earn net interest margins well above those of many leading banks. These high margins translate into high returns on equity, which the company targets at 16-18 percent over the medium term. (Actual ROE in 2021 was 24 percent. When the company came public in 2014, its ROE was a paltry four percent.)..” (Click here to read the full text)\\n\\n6. Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $877,219,000\\n\\nCelanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is a Texas-based technology and specialty materials company that manufactures and sells high performance engineered polymers in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments – Engineered Materials, Acetate Tow, and Acetyl Chain. Warren Buffett boosted his Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) stake by 7% in Q3 2022, holding 9.71 million shares worth $877.2 million, representing 0.29% of the total securities.\\n\\nOn November 10, Deutsche Bank analyst David Begleiter reiterated a Buy rating on Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) but lowered the price target on the shares to $105 from $110 following the Q3 results. He said that an EPS of $13 to $14 is achievable in 2023.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 36 hedge funds were bullish on Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, with collective stakes worth $1.5 billion, compared to 36 funds in the prior quarter worth $1.8 billion. Thomas E. Claugus’ GMT Capital held a significant stake in the company, comprising 1.3 million shares valued at $116.6 million.\\n\\nIn addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ),\\xa0 Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) is one of the top picks of Warren Buffett.\\n\\nHere is what Vltava Fund has to say about Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stocks of Celanese (CE).\\n\\nCelanese is the world’s largest producer of acetic acid and its chemical derivatives, including vinyl acetate monomers and emulsions. Their applications are used in a wide range of industries, such as automotive tobacco, coatings, construction, energy, telecommunications, food, and medical. Celanese recently closed the acquisition of a large part of DuPont’s business, which will make Celanese an even bigger player in the industry while reducing the cyclicality of it business. The acquisition is quite large and should deliver significant value to shareholders that in our view is not at all presently reflected in the share price. Celanese is a business that stands more or less aside from the main interests of most investors, but it is a company with very high returns on capital, strong free cash flow, and historically very efficient resource allocation.”\\n\\nClick to continue reading and see Warren Buffett\\'s Stock Portfolio and 5 Newest Investments in 2022.\\n\\nSuggested articles:\\n\\nKen Fisher Top Dividend Stocks Google Investment Portfolio Ray Dalio\\'s Top 10 Dividend Stocks\\n\\nDisclosure: None.

By comparison, the S&P 500 has returned 30,209% in the same time frame. A single dollar invested in Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 would have turned into $36,714, while the same dollar invested into the S&P 500 would have returned just $303.\\n\\nBut not even Buffett is immune to the law of large numbers. The bigger something gets, the harder it is for it to keep growing exponentially. Berkshire Hathaway has managed to double its share price in twice one year exactly twice — and both instances were back in the 1970s.\\n\\nAs Buffett put it over a decade ago, “The highest rates of return I ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts back then. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee it.”\\n\\nWhy Buffett Envies You\\n\\nBut it’s more than the law of large numbers working against the Oracle of Omaha today. Buffett — and every other billionaire investor and institutional player — is essentially banned from investing in the most explosive opportunities in any meaningful way.\\n\\nLet’s say Buffett wanted to invest in a small-cap company valued at $1 million. He could legally invest a few thousand dollars and hopefully, watch it soar to $100,000 or more.\\n\\nBut that would be a pittance for Berkshire Hathaway, which is a juggernaut valued at hundreds of billions of dollars today. A home run on a small investment won’t move the needle for Buffett.\\n\\nHis other option would be to invest far more — say $500,000. But then he would own so much of the company that he would need to file a 13D Schedule form with the Securities & Exchange Commission and take on the headaches that come with being what is legally known as a “beneficial owner.”\\n\\nBuffett will continue to collect hundreds of millions of dollars per year in dividends from the vast amount of shares he owns in household names like Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBut he won’t be scoring any more 10,000%-plus winners as he did with insurance stock GEICO back in the 1950s and 1960s.\\n\\nBenzinga tracks a number of opportunities that are effectively closed to investors like Buffett.\\n\\nAfter all, small-cap stocks, for all their volatility and increased risk, have historically outperformed their bigger brothers over time.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), which has sold 1.3 billion iPhones since 2007 and reported a $19.4 billion profit last quarter?\\n\\nOr Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which went from selling just 937 cars in 2009 to over 300,000 last year?\\n\\nSome savvy income investors might consider Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO). The tobacco giant, formerly Phillip Morris International Inc., has grown its dividends by 631% since 2002. That streak of dividend hikes is possible when you sell an addictive product to hundreds of millions of people.\\n\\nBut there’s one little-known company that left these household names in the dust.\\n\\nThe Unknown Stock That Beat Every Wall Street Darling\\n\\nMonster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) is a company no one ever described as changing the world. It’s not putting an iPhone into every third human’s hand or solving climate change.\\n\\nYet this energy drink company returned 87,560% from 2000 to 2020 — enough to turn every $1 invested into $876.\\n\\nWhy was Monster Beverage able to dramatically outperform these world-changing companies?\\n\\nPart of the reason comes from its size — Monster Beverage recorded $92 million in revenue in 2002 while Apple reported $5.7 billion. A smaller company can grow revenue — and ultimately its earnings and share price — much faster than a company that’s already a behemoth.\\n\\nBut there’s bigger factor at play. Apple spent $446 million on research and development in 2002 to stay ahead of its competitors and maintain its existing operations. By 2022, its annual operating costs had reached $274 billion.\\n\\nTo keep the lights on, Apple had to spend $274 billion or the company could no longer make and sell products. By contrast, Monster Beverage spent just $4.6 billion on operating costs in 2022.\\n\\nIt turns out that an energy-drink business is a lot less capital-intensive than a tech business — and this difference, compounded over the years, means that Monster Beverage had hundreds of billions of dollars more to plow into growing its business by expanding operations and claiming greater market share.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA similar dynamic benefitted Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO). If you’ve ever wondered why the ticker symbol is KO rather than CO or CC, it’s because Wall Street settled on an acronym for “knock out.” The sentiment was that investing in Coca-Cola was a slam dunk because the invaluable brand name commanded loyalty from hundreds of millions around the world. How could investors go wrong?\\n\\nSure enough, $100 invested in Coca-Cola at the time of its 1919 initial public offering (IPO) would have turned into $1.25 million a century later. A lot of factors are behind that performance, but it’s not a coincidence that Coca-Cola had to pay just $24 billion in operating costs in 2020, or less that 10% of what Apple paid.\\n\\nBenzinga has a lot to say on the battles between tech giants to capture hundreds of billions of dollars in market share of revolutionary trends like blockchain technology, 5G and clean energy. But as stocks like Monster Beverage show, slow and steady can sometimes win the race.\\n\\nBenzinga is tracking one company with striking parallels to Monster Beverage. It also has a product designed to improve energy levels and performance. It’s already profitable, but with just $17 million in sales since 2012, is even smaller than Monster Beverage was at the turn of the century.\\n\\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out AQR Capital\\'s Top 5 Stock Picks.\\n\\nCliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s trend-following strategies are racking up significant gains this year as quants win inflation-driven price patterns in almost all asset categories. AQR Capital’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, representing about $1 billion in assets, returned more than 9% to investors in the 30-day period ending October 6, which takes the total returns this year to 70%. Simultaneously, AQR’s $450 million Alternative Trend Strategy has posted a 47% gain in 2022. AQR’s primary strategy is to utilize derivatives to follow price trends in most asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and credit-default swaps.\\n\\nBloomberg data suggests that a broad index tracking rule-based trend investing from Societe Generale SA is up 31%, marking one of the best gains for this year. Comparatively, AQR’s primary mutual fund has returned about 38% to investors this year. Yao Hua Ooi, principal at AQR, said in an interview:\\n\\n“If macroeconomic volatility stays high and asset classes continue to show big moves in the same direction, we expect to see continued high returns for these strategies.”\\n\\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2022, AQR Capital had discretionary assets under management of $145.45 billion, and the hedge fund managed a Q3 portfolio worth $41 billion. Some of the most notable stocks in the AQR portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWe selected the top 10 stocks from the AQR portfolio as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to the hedge fund’s stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities.\\n\\nStory continues AQR Capital\\'s Performance, AUM and Top Stock Picks\\n\\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management\\n\\nAQR Capital\\'s Performance, AUM and Top Stock Picks\\n\\n10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 177\\n\\nAQR Capital\\'s Stake Value: $356,988,000\\n\\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been part of AQR Capital’s portfolio since the third quarter of 2013, apart from a few breaks over the years. Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that AQR Capital owns 2.6 million shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) worth about $357 million, representing 0.87% of the total portfolio.\\n\\nOn November 15, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated an Equal Weight rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $100 from $105. Indicators of a soft ad market continued to increase through Q3 earnings season as 14 of 19 firms he covers in the sector either missed Q3 ad revenue estimates or slashed forward growth expectations, the analyst told investors. He reduced his 2023 U.S. online advertising and e-commerce estimates and now forecasts about 6% and 5% growth in online advertising and e-commerce, respectively.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was part of 177 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 185 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held a prominent stake in the company, comprising 11.8 million shares worth $1.60 billion.\\n\\nLike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top stock picks of AQR Capital.\\n\\nBaron Funds made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the world’s largest social network, were down 16% during the quarter primarily due to broader digital advertising weakness and continued difficulties with advertising effectiveness as a result of Apple’s enhanced privacy features implemented in late 2021. We believe Meta will successfully resolve its short-term advertising technology issues by increasing AI adoption and by driving greater in-App user engagement with businesses, enabling it to grow its understanding of people’s interests based on first-party data. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, and technological scale to provide global advertisers targeted marketing capabilities at scale, with additional monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as Reels (Meta’s competing solution to TikTok) and e-commerce.”\\n\\n9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 67\\n\\nAQR Capital\\'s Stake Value: $365,686,000\\n\\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American provider of health services in the United States. The company operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and Retail/LTC segments. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital owns 3.8 million shares of CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) worth $365.6 million as of Q3 2022, representing 0.89% of the total 13F securities.\\n\\nOn November 2, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $2.09 and a revenue of $81.2 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $4.42 billion, respectively. For full-year 2022, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) raised the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.55-$8.65 from $8.40-$8.60, compared to an $8.55 consensus. The company lifted cash flow from operations guidance range to $13.5 billion-$14.5 billion from $12.5 billion-$13.5 billion.\\n\\nRaymond James analyst John Ransom on November 14 maintained an Outperform rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $115 from $120 following Q3 results that were better-than-anticipated, supported by robust results in HCB, while the PBM and retail were comparatively in line. For 2024, the analyst sees risk to management\\'s EPS estimate of low double-digit growth given the macro headwinds, but believes that it has already been priced into the shares.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 67 hedge funds were bullish on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 65 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a significant position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $293.7 million.\\n\\nHere is what Vltava Fund has to say about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.\\n\\nWe took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.\\n\\nThis is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”\\n\\n8. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\\n\\nAQR Capital\\'s Stake Value: $379,998,000\\n\\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), the American oil and gas supermajor, has consistently featured on the AQR portfolio since the last quarter of 2010, apart from a few breaks over the years. In Q3 2022, the hedge fund owned 4.35 million shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) worth nearly $380 million, representing 0.92% of the total 13F securities.\\n\\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced on November 14 that in collaboration with Pertamina, an Indonesian national oil company, it has signed a $2.5 billion agreement to further assess plans for an offshore carbon capture and storage project in the country. This project will have the potential to store about 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nOn November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd raised the price target on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $131 from $113 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The Q3 results were incrementally bullish for the integrated oil 2023 macro outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were long Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 33.8 million shares worth approximately $3 billion.\\n\\nIn its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”\\n\\n7. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\\n\\nAQR Capital\\'s Stake Value: $381,898,000\\n\\nAQR Capital has owned a position in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) since the third quarter of 2012, except for minor breaks over the years. AQR strengthened its hold on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) by a whopping 327% in Q3 2022. The hedge fund owned 1.4 million shares of the company worth about $382 million, representing 0.93% of the total 13F portfolio.\\n\\nOn November 11, Elon Musk\\'s Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced that it added 43 Supercharger stations, including 174 Superchargers, in the Chinese mainland during October. These new facilities are based in 31 cities, including Shanghai, Chongqing, Nanjing, and Chengdu, among others.\\n\\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives on November 10 removed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) from the firm\\'s \"Best Ideas\" list, citing his short-term view that things are \"increasingly becoming more challenged,\" though his longer-term bullish view of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains largely unchanged. He sees \"a very nervous few months ahead for Tesla investors\" as they \"remain the ones that have been punched again and again by the Musk Twitter antics,\" Ives said. However, the stock is \"deep in the investor penalty box until deliveries hit in early January,\" and the analyst maintained an Outperform rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares.\\n\\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 88 funds reported owning stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 73 funds in the prior quarter worth $7.1 billion. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management held a significant stake in the company, consisting of more than 4 million shares worth $1.08 billion.\\n\\nAlger Capital made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Shares outperformed during the quarter despite covid 19 shutdowns at the company’s shanghai production plant early in the period. During this quarter, the company also ramped up production at its newer Germany and Texas plants. While investors were aware of these challenging variables, the company’s quarterly results exceeded expectations thanks to lower-than-expected operating expenses. Investors are aware that ramping up electric vehicle production is challenging and recognize it’s difficult to estimate production rates.”\\n\\n6. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 269\\n\\nAQR Capital\\'s Stake Value: $422,010,000\\n\\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a long-term holding of AQR Capital. The hedge fund has owned a stake in the company since the last quarter of 2010, except for a few breaks over the years. In the third quarter of 2022, AQR held 3.7 million shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) worth $422 million, representing 1.02% of the total portfolio.\\n\\nOn November 16, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, would establish an infrastructure region in Spain and invest up to $2.6 billion in the country over the span of a decade. This will generate more than 1,300 full-time jobs in Spain and add approximately $1.8 billion to the country’s gross domestic product.\\n\\nMoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton on November 15 assumed coverage of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Outperform rating and a $118 price target. The analyst does not believe in the bear case scenario of peak e-commerce penetration and thinks e-commerce penetration growth will continue at the historical pace. He prefers market share gainers and finds it \"challenging to have an appetite for market share losers\" as he noted that the algorithm of the internet \"creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for continued share loss once it starts.\"\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 269 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 252 funds in the prior quarter. The collective stakes in Q3 increased to $34.6 billion from $30 billion in Q2.\\n\\nIn addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is backed by AQR Capital and other elite hedge funds.\\n\\nBaron Funds made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest e-commerce retailer and cloud services provider. Shares of Amazon increased 6% in the quarter after the company reported strong results with 7% year-over-year revenue growth driven by 33% growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s leading cloud computing service, while guiding for an acceleration in third quarter revenue growth, which is expected to be between 13% and 17% year-over-year. Amazon’s share of e-commerce is roughly 40%, far ahead of competition, yet domestic e-commerce accounted for only 14.5% of total retail sales (according to U.S. Census Bureau data for the second quarter of 2022), implying durable growth opportunities ahead. Internationally, the opportunity remains large as Amazon still has less than a 2% market share of international retail spending. Its advertising share is also only 3% and growing, underpinned by the structural closed-loop systems it enables (merchants know exactly whether their ad dollars resulted in a purchase since they are all done on the Amazon platform), which enables accurate targeting and measurement.

At a time when capital can earn 4% today for no risk at all, those peddling fortunes built on cash flows in five years’ time are increasingly struggling.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s no bad thing.\\n\\nWeaker parts of the tech sector have been slimming down for a year or more already. The significance of recent layoffs is in the fact that they have been at companies that until quite recently were widely considered to be invulnerable, due to their commanding position in the new megatrends of the age, be it streaming, social media, e-commerce, or self-driving cars.\\n\\nFacebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is cutting 11,000, or one in seven of its staff worldwide. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is reportedly looking to cut 10,000, admittedly a much smaller share of its 1.5 million-strong workforce. Twitter, under the uniquely aggressive culling of its new owner Elon Musk, is cutting numbers by half.\\n\\nStripe, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), along with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) have all trodden the same path this year. Every day, the list lengthens: this week alone, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has announced it will cut 4,100 jobs, while streaming device maker Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) said on Thursday it will cut 200. In both cases, that’s around 5% of the total.\\n\\nOne common theme running through the narrative is the weakness of the advertising sector, which has both cyclical and structural elements.\\n\\nThe structural element is that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounts for over a quarter of the world’s mobile devices and a larger share among richer consumers, has made it all but impossible to sell more highly-priced targeted ads by tightening its privacy policy. Apple users appear to like this feature, so there is little chance of it being reversed.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe cyclical element is essentially a reversion to the mean: ad spending, which is never more than a derivative of consumer incomes, boomed during the pandemic when manufacturers had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bombard the bored and homebound with ideas on how to spend their stimulus checks. It started shrinking when inflation started eating into disposable incomes and that process accelerated as fears of job insecurity spread around the world.\\n\\nConsumer confidence is now at an all-time low in countries like the U.K. and Germany.\\n\\nAnother common thread is the over-confidence bred by the extraordinary and patently unsustainable policy settings of the pandemic years. Too many people believed either that the good times would last forever, or that, more charitably, the pandemic would accelerate irreversible long-term trends to digitization and automation. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and, on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy both admitted to having over-hired.\\n\\nA third thread is that too many of the sector’s long shots have turned out to be simply too long. While the core businesses of companies like Meta and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) make good money, the pet projects they are supporting on the company balance sheet are losing money hand over fist.\\n\\nAltimeter Capital’s Mark Gerstner begged Zuckerberg last month to halve spending on his Metaverse projects to a maximum of $5 billion a year. Chris Hohn, head of London-based hedge fund TCI, directed the same criticism at Google owner Alphabet this week, calling out CEO Sundar Pichai for blowing $20 billion over the last five years on its “Other Bets” division, whose largest element is the Waymo self-driving venture.\\n\\nThe over-expansion at Big Tech has been bad not just for the companies’ shareholders (Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are down by 43%, 67%, and 32%, respectively, this year), but for the U.S. economy in general, sucking up talent that could have been deployed more productively.\\n\\n“We have a shortage of talent in Silicon Valley,\" Altimeter\\'s Gerstner said. \"Meta and other large companies have made it very difficult for start-ups to hire.” Gerstner said he’s “confident that these employees will find replacement jobs and quickly be back to work on important inventions that will move us all forward.”\\n\\nThe economic data, so far, appear to be proving him right. While the number of layoffs is clearly increasing, the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits has not risen markedly from a 60-year low. Clearly, those being laid off have plenty of opportunities elsewhere. Enough soft landings at the personal level give the economy a good chance of achieving one at the macro level.\\n\\nThat reality may go some way to explaining the resilience of U.S. consumption in recent weeks and months, even though the outlook has clearly darkened. More consumers may be losing their jobs, but if they are confident enough of finding a new one quickly, they will be less afraid of dipping into savings to keep up their consumption levels.\\n\\nAgainst such a backdrop, despite the obvious human distress, there are good reasons not to be too downhearted at Big Tech’s downsizing. What has been seen so far is more an exercise in capital discipline and the unwinding of excess, not a sign of a vicious downward spiral. As days of reckoning go, the market has seen much worse.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nWeekly comic: Big Tech\\'s day of reckoning\\n\\nTake Five: Black Friday test\\n\\nLagarde: Rate hike path dependent on inflation outlook', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-comic-big-techs-day-022222952.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZN.US', 'CSCO.US', 'GOGL34.SA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'GOOG.MX', 'GOOG.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'LYFT.US', 'META.US', 'NFC.F', 'NFC.XETRA', 'NFLX.MX'], 'tags': ['AMAZON', 'DAY OF RECKONING', 'FACEBOOK OWNER', 'STRUCTURAL ELEMENT', 'TECH', 'UNIMAGINABLE WEALTH'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.99, 'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.112}}, {'date': '2022-11-17T19:08:57+00:00', 'title': 'Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 10 Dividend Stock Picks', 'content': \"In this article, we discuss top dividend stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)\\n\\nFisher Asset Management's Stake Value: $1,109,194,000\\n\\nDividend Yield as of November 16: 1.13%\\n\\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American multinational financial services company that offers banking and other related services. The company is one of the latest holdings of Fisher Asset Management. The hedge fund opened its position in the company with over 15.4 million shares, worth over $1.1 billion. The company represented 0.83% of billionaire Ken Fisher's portfolio. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is another prominent holding of Ken Fisher in Q3.\\n\\nOn October 26, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with its previous dividend. The company raised its dividends twice this year, after ceasing dividend growth during the pandemic. As of November 16, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.13%.\\n\\nIn November, Deutsche Bank lifted its price target on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) to $101 with a Buy rating on the shares.

These stakes have a total value of over $4.5 billion.\\n\\nLVS Advisory mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“We purchased shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) around the same time as Interactive Brokers. The investment thesis is similar. Schwab benefits from higher interest rates as it collects income earned from client cash. While IBKR mostly serves retail investors, Schwab has a greater emphasis on wealth advisors and corporate retirement plans. B2B channels are sticker than retail traders and give Schwab pricing power to collect a greater portion of the interest earned than IBKR. Schwab is a more mature business and has fewer reinvestment opportunities than IBKR (which is why I prefer IBKR on the margin); however, Schwab has authorized a massive $15 billion share buyback program (!) representing over 10% of the company’s market cap at the time of announcement. Given that Schwab trades for a mid-teens price-to-earnings multiple and has a low cost of capital, the share buyback should be highly accretive. The combined tailwind from higher interest rates and the buyback program will lead to attractive earnings per share growth over the coming years.”\\n\\n9. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding.

Here is what the firm has to say:\\n\\n“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.\\n\\nIn terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)…\\n\\n…To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”\\n\\n6.

The company operates through three segments – Home & Outdoor, Health & Wellness, and Beauty. Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) is one of the top small-cap stocks in the Ken Fisher portfolio. Fisher boosted his stake in Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) by 16% in the third quarter of 2022, holding 479,739 shares worth $46.2 million.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nOn October 5, Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $2.27 and a revenue of $521.4 million, topping Wall Street consensus by $0.06 and $2.33 million, respectively. The revenue gained 9.7% year-over-year.\\n\\nCL King analyst Steven Marotta told investors on October 5 that Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE)’s Q2 was broadly in line with Street estimates, but the outlook for FY23 has been impacted given the negative patterns in consumer behavior and wholesale channel pace-of-orders.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s data, 20 hedge funds were long Helen of Troy Limited (NASDAQ:HELE) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 16 funds in the preceding quarter.

The Company’s healthcare and housewares businesses were major beneficiaries during the pandemic, and both we and the Company have been expecting a normalization of demand in this business. Further, the post-pandemic normalization of demand patterns at major customers such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon have further weighed on the Company – both in terms of fundamentals and in terms of market sentiment, plus stock valuation. Finally, decades-high inflation in key consumer staples categories such as food and other necessities has diverted some spending away from the more discretionary product categories supplied by Helen of Troy. Despite all these headwinds, the Company has been able to hold on to most of the business that it gained during the Pandemic. Revenues in the most recent quarter were +26% above the same quarter two years ago, and we find the stock’s valuation to be extremely attractive at the moment, at levels last seen in the 2008- 2009 recession period, when the Company was under former (and, in our opinion, inept) management.”\\n\\n9.

Even though we were, and continue to be significantly underweight these stocks, our investments here hurt our performance the most as individual stocks like Revolve Group, Inc.

Even after a bounce this month, the Nasdaq 100 is still down 29% from its record close.\\n\\n“Big tech still has secular growth drivers, but the growth will be lower, which means they’ll have valuations under the levels they had when times were good,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “That could mean, from a sentiment perspective, that there will be some reservation about jumping back in.”\\n\\nInvestors’ risk appetite got a shock this year when inflation raged out of control, prompting the Federal Reserve to begin its most aggressive campaign of interest rate increases since the early 1980s. Multiple routs ensued as investors fled the high-growth, high-valuation stocks that had prospered in the era of near-zero global interest rates.\\n\\nAmong US benchmarks, the Nasdaq 100, which was created in 1985 by the National Association of Securities Dealers, has taken the brunt of the selling. Technology companies account for half of its value. Add in some companies that are classified as parts of other sectors, like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., and the weighting jumps above 60%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNow, 11 members are down 50% or more this year, compared to just two stocks in the same period last year. The selloff has wiped $5.7 trillion off the benchmark’s market value, and lowered its valuation to 21 times projected earnings from 29 a year ago. The tech gauge fell 1.2% on Thursday, extending losses for a second session.\\n\\nA report a week ago of cooler-than-expected inflation triggered the steepest rally in more than two years, giving new vigor to battered stocks like Meta Platforms Inc. and DocuSign Inc. Still, one central bank governor said the Fed has a “ways to go” before it pauses its cycle of interest rate increases, and plenty of economists expect a recession that will hammer corporate earnings in the coming months.\\n\\n“Things have gotten less bad, which is good, but that isn’t enough to give me confidence that valuations are at the bottom,” said Jordan Stuart, client portfolio manager at Federated Hermes.\\n\\nInvestors are still fleeing the sector: Bank of America Corp.’s latest survey highlighted that fund managers are the most underweight technology they’ve been since August 2006. Traders of exchange-traded funds are placing a record wager against the big comeback in tech stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\n“The risk appetite today isn’t there, but it will come,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and CIO of Defiance ETFs. Portfolios in coming years will be more diversified. “A few years ago, it would have been fine to pick the FAANGs, set it and forget it. That has changed, the process is more thoughtful.”\\n\\nTech Chart of the Day\\n\\nApple Inc. has embarked on the most aggressive share buyback program on Wall Street in recent years. The iPhone maker, which typically tops up its share repurchase authorization after its fiscal second quarter ends in March, has expanded its program by at least $50 billion every year since 2019. Apple spent almost $90 billion last year -- equal to about the market value of Citigroup Inc. -- and $32 billion more than the next highest company, according to Bloomberg data.\\n\\nTop Tech Stories\\n\\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. reported a surprise loss after quarterly revenue barely grew, as China’s rigid Covid controls continue to sap consumer sentiment. Nvidia Corp. assured investors Wednesday that demand remains strong for its artificial-intelligence and data-center chips, even as the company struggles with a slowdown in the personal-computer market. NetEase Inc. and Blizzard Entertainment Inc. plan to end their 14-year partnership after January, depriving the Chinese firm of a slice of revenue and suspending service for some of the country’s most popular games. Elon Musk will be creating room for competitors of Twitter Inc. to emerge if he breaks the “ethos” of the influential social media company, former Chairman Patrick Pichette said. Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s plan to dole out $20 billion of stock in meal delivery giant Meituan triggered a broad selloff of Chinese internet stocks on Thursday as investors fear more divestments by the online gaming company are in the offing. Taiwan expanded tax breaks for companies that invest in technology research and production in an attempt to strengthen the island’s semiconductor industry and help maintain its leading position in the global chip supply chain. Shares of One 97 Communications Ltd., the parent of India’s leading digital payments brand Paytm, plunged in Mumbai as a unit of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. lowered its stake in the company. Grab Holdings Ltd. reported a narrower third-quarter loss than analysts had estimated, helped by cost cuts by the Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery giant.\\n\\n--With assistance from Matt Turner and Tom Contiliano.\\n\\n(Updates to market open.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nFTX Was an Empty Black Box All Along North America’s EV Future Hinges on a North Carolina Turtle Pond Fatal Crashes Highlight Rising Danger of Illicit Charter Flights Twitter’s Layoffs Are the Perfect Example of How Not to Fire People Google’s Moonshot Lab Is Now in the Strawberry-Counting Business\\n\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-record-high-nasdaq-long-115515163.html', 'symbols': ['0700.HK', '9999.HK', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'NEH.F', 'NETTF.US', 'NNN1.F', 'NNND.F', 'NTES.US', 'NTESN.MX', 'TCEHY.US', 'TCTZF.US'], 'tags': ['BLOOMBERG', 'INVESTORS', 'NASDAQ', 'NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SECURITIES DEALERS', 'TECH STOCKS', 'TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.987, 'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.099}}, {'date': '2022-11-17T14:37:00+00:00', 'title': \"Netflix's Competition Can't Stay Cheap Forever.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\\n\\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Apple with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Apple\\n\\nApple's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\\n\\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Apple's EPS has grown 28% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\\n\\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Apple maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.9% to US$394b. That's encouraging news for the company!\\n\\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\\n\\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Apple's future EPS 100% free.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAre Apple Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\\n\\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$2.4t company like Apple. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.5b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.06% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.\\n\\nShould You Add Apple To Your Watchlist?\\n\\nFor growth investors, Apple's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 1 warning sign  with Apple , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\\n\\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The measure also gives another 5% tax break to companies whose investment in advanced equipment reaches a set level, and is aimed at encouraging them to keep spending on production and development in Taiwan.\\n\\nOver the past year many countries have ramped up support for their domestic chip industries, promising to give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to companies which increase production in those markets and diversify away from China and Taiwan. Those promises have led to a rash of new factories being built or planned in the US, Japan and in Europe, worrying some in Taiwan that its pre-eminent position in the semiconductor industry is at risk.\\n\\nRead more: Biden Signs Chips Bill, Unleashing Funding for US Production\\n\\nAs geopolitical tensions have risen between the US and China, businesses have been preparing contingency plans in case foreign companies are no longer able to operate in China or there’s a military confrontation around Taiwan. The increasing global concern about the concentration of chip production on the island has prompted more firms and nations to try and move output away from Taiwan or away from local chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSamsung Electronics Co. said this week that the global technology industry is in search of alternative sources for advanced semiconductors, given rising political risks. And Apple Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook disclosed in an internal meeting that the company is preparing to begin sourcing chips from a plant under construction in Arizona in the US, a major step toward reducing the company’s reliance on Asian production.\\n\\nHowever, Cook was likely referring to an factory that will be run by TSMC. The plant is slated for a 2024 opening and the company is already considering a second US facility, part of a broader push to increase chip production there.\\n\\nTo counter these moves away from the island, Taiwan’s government has been keen to attract and tout foreign investment in the domestic semiconductor industry. On Wednesday, President Tsai Ing-wen met with representatives from ASML Holding NV, a key supplier for advanced chipmaking equipment. The company plans to invest NT$30 billion in northern Taiwan, CNA reported, citing the mayor of New Taipei city.\\n\\nThe new tax concessions are aimed at helping that effort and cementing Taiwan’s position in key industries, according to an official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who spoke at a briefing after the announcement.\\n\\nThe details of the new tax breaks were announced by the ministry, which said it was a response to new competition amid global supply chain restructuring and was crucial to the future development of Taiwanese industry. The proposal will be delivered to the legislature for a vote, with the government aiming for it to come into effect from January next year and run through the end of 2029.\\n\\n“Taiwan needs the world, and the world needs Taiwan even more,” Cabinet Spokesperson Lo Ping-cheng said at a briefing in Taipei after the announcement. “If Taiwan’s chip sector is better, it will be more beneficial to the world economy.”\\n\\nTaiwan remains a vital but vulnerable component of the global tech supply chain. Led by TSMC, the island currently manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips used for military and corporate computing services. Apple, MediaTek Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., which control more than 85% of the global handset chip market, all rely on supplies from TSMC.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nFTX Was an Empty Black Box All Along North America’s EV Future Hinges on a North Carolina Turtle Pond Twitter’s Layoffs Are the Perfect Example of How Not to Fire People Google’s Moonshot Lab Is Now in the Strawberry-Counting Business Fatal Crashes Highlight Rising Danger of Illicit Charter Flights\\n\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-approves-tax-breaks-fight-050552815.html', 'symbols': ['2330.TW', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'TSFA.F', 'TSFA.STU', 'TSM.US', 'TSMC34.SA', 'TSMN.MX'], 'tags': ['BLOOMBERG', 'CHIP PRODUCTION', 'SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY', 'TAIWAN', 'TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.841, 'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.06}}, {'date': '2022-11-16T23:00:02+00:00', 'title': 'Target, Amazon and 4 More Retailers That Will Reward You for Turning in Your Old Stuff', 'content': \"hapabapa / iStock.com\\n\\nIf you have unused electronics, video games or even car seats at home, you may be able to trade these items in for gift cards, coupons and more.\\n\\nLearn: States Whose Economies Are Failing vs. States Whose Economies Are Thriving\\r\\nCheck: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves Now\\n\\nPopular retailers like Target, Amazon and Walmart offer trade-in programs that allow you to cash in on your old stuff -- here are all the details you need to know.

According to Mr. Dalio, we will not be having a \"sustainable interest rate that is going to be a real adequate interest rate\", and so he is steering clear of debt instruments. Mr. Dalio said that according to his analysis and estimates, the interest rate that will equalize the inflation rate sits between 4% and 5% and that brings the \"real bond yield\" to \"four and a half percent\" and \"the economy cannot take an interest rate much higher than that before it is going to be negative\".\\n\\nBridgewater Associates\\' Stock Portfolio\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its exposure to 300 previously held positions, reduced its stakes in 498 securities, initiated 61 new positions, and exited 180 positions.

That's in an effort to diversify its supply chain and pivot from Asia. This is according to a report from Bloomberg.\\n\\nAnd for more on this, let's bring in Yahoo! Finance's tech editor Dan Howley. And you know, Dan, there's been so much attention on chips and the buildout of the chip manufacturing business in the US. We already knew that Apple is sort of going in this direction but this is an interesting development.\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it really is. This could be for the iPhone. This could be for the Mac. Really the big deal is it's TSMC. They-- this is likely the plant that they're talking about building out in Arizona that would go up and running in 2024. So not quite tomorrow but, you know, a little bit down the line.\\n\\nAnd I think for Apple, it just speaks to the broader problems that they've had with China in the past year. And also just looking to the future saying, you know, look, countries are talking about trying to diversify. More companies are jumping in, saying, look, we don't want to just rely on one area. We've seen the downside of that, just sourcing all of our product from China or, you know, from Taiwan with, you know, kind of the saber rattling back and forth with China and the US over Taiwan.\\n\\nSo it, you know, kind of behooves a company like Apple to say, look, we're going to start moving our productivity capabilities or our supply chain, away from those areas. And we've seen them talk about moving to India, to Vietnam, moving out of China. More-- don't get me wrong, it's not happening tomorrow. It's going to take quite a while for them to move a lot of their capacity or at least start having more available on a global scale.\\n\\nBut this is really a big move for them. And frankly, for the chip manufacturing capabilities in the US, this is Apple we're talking about. They sell millions of iPhones, you know, millions of watches, millions of AirPods and laptops. And you know, all of those need chips. And TSMC makes those chips.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBRAD SMITH: So the timing around this sounds like 2024 for end users of the Apple products of the Apple ecosystem. You know, what would that difference look like and how soon thereafter?\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: It would prob-- honestly, you know, a chip, an advanced chip can take six months to be built, you know, like from start to finish. It can take quite a while. And you know, there's no guarantee that this is gonna be the most advanced chips that Apple needs.\\n\\nSo I think, you know, you could say, maybe just conservatively, a year. You know, that they would go from start to into end user products. It doesn't take that long to make an iPhone.\\n\\nBRIAN SOZZI: Dan, why is Intel not getting any business here?\\n\\nDAN HOWLEY: It's interesting. I mean, you know, Apple and Intel don't have the best relationship, obviously. Apple kind of kicked them to the curb, as the kids say. And you know, I think that might be part of it.\\n\\nBut they are trying to build up their own fab [? four-- ?] third-party companies. So they might be part of this in the long run. But at this point, Apple has worked with TSMC. They know what Apple wants, right?\\n\\nSo it's that quality control I think that really is part of it. Apple is crazy about that. And so the fact that they have TSMC already and this could be a TSMC-- building that plant, this could be the illusion that Tim Cook was making to that plant.

In October, U.S. consumer prices surged 7.7% from a year ago — down from 9.1% in June but still worryingly high.\\n\\nSpiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.\\n\\nFortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike.\\n\\nIn a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.\\n\\nHere are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.\\n\\nDon't miss\\n\\nYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis) Want to invest your spare change but don't know where to start?

As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.\\n\\nBusiness is booming. In Q3, the company’s revenue jumped 24% year over year to $13.6 billion.\\n\\nAmerican Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth around $23.2 billion.\\n\\nBerkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.\\n\\nAmerican Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.4%.\\n\\nCoca-Cola (KO)\\n\\nCoca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.\\n\\nRead more:You’re probably overpaying when you shop online — get this free tool before Black Friday\\n\\nAdd solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.\\n\\nBuffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $24.1 billion.\\n\\nYou can lock in a dividend yield of 2.9% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.\\n\\nApple (AAPL)\\n\\nNo one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 14 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.\\n\\nEarlier this year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.8 billion devices.\\n\\nWhile competitors offer cheaper devices, millions of users don’t want to live outside of the Apple ecosystem. The ecosystem acts as an economic moat, allowing the company to earn oversized profits.\\n\\nIt also means that as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.\\n\\nToday, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 250%.\\n\\nApple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.\\n\\nChevron (CVX)\\n\\nOne of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $23.8 billion of the energy giant as of Sept. 30 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.\\n\\nToday, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.\\n\\nIt’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.\\n\\nOil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 16% year to date. And the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep that trend going.\\n\\nStrong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings increased 84% year over year. The stock is up more than 50% in 2022.\\n\\nThe company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.0%.\\n\\nWhat to read next\\n\\n‘Imagine you are laid off’: Suze Orman's 3 tough-love tips to prepare for the recession ahead ‘Not living their life to impress others’: Here are the top car brands that rich Americans earning more than $200K drive most — and why you should too Morgan Stanley: Prices for Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet watches will keep plunging due to a flood of supply — but these 3 real assets remain scarce and coveted\\n\\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

And anti-Airbnb sentiment has bubbled up everywhere, from Reddit to the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nYet the so-called #Airbnbust, like most social media phenomena, seems to inaccurately reflect what’s actually happening in the real world. Total demand for short-term rentals actually rose 24% in September compared with the same month last year, according to a recent report by AirDNA, a vacation rental data platform. Average daily rates rose a staggering 31.9% compared with 2019.\\n\\nSo, based on social media, everyone is fed up with Airbnb. Based on what’s happening in the real world, Airbnb is doing better than ever. What gives?\\n\\nThe Apple effect\\n\\nRemember Apple’s “Batterygate” scandal? Back in 2017 (roughly 5,000 years ago), the company was accused of “planned obsolescence” with software updates for its iPhones. Basically, Apple was sued for intentionally slowing down its older phones in an effort to get more customers to upgrade to newer models.\\n\\nSocial media was filled with vitriolic backlash at the time, with iPhone users proclaiming that they would switch to Android devices in droves. Did that happen? Well, Apple was a $671 billion company in 2017 and has more than tripled in value to $2.5 trillion since. So, um, no.\\n\\nThe problem for Apple users and Airbnb guests is that, while they might not like everything these companies are doing, they like the alternatives even less.\\n\\nSwitching to Android means learning a new interface and becoming a possibly dreaded green bubble on iMessage. And switching from Airbnb means either going “back” to hotels, which have their own drawbacks, or using Airbnb’s competitors, which aren’t much better.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSomeone trying to book a house with friends in Palm Springs or backpack through South America on a shoestring is still likely to turn to Airbnb. There simply aren’t many good alternatives.\\n\\nAt least, not yet.\\n\\nHostel takeover?\\n\\nI chatted with Lee Gonzalez, who, with her sister Lauren, is trying something daring: Building hostels in America. Their company, L&L hospitality, opened a new hostel in New York City in 2014, and another in Portland, Oregon, in 2021. She says they struggled with the word “hostel” early on, but have since come to embrace it.\\n\\n“Many travelers categorically reject hostels in the U.S. — they think of the YMCA,” Gonzalez says. “In the end, we like the word. We want people to come with that hostel attitude.”\\n\\nTheir Portland property — called Lolo Pass — bucks the stereotypical hostel image of grimy dorms with an even grimier guy noodling on guitar in the common room (at least, that’s my image). The rooms at Loss Pass are minimal but stylish. And the emphasis is on connecting guests with each other and the surrounding area.\\n\\n“We make sure our programming is plugged into the neighborhood,” she explains. “The spaces are just as much for the neighborhood as for the guests.”\\n\\nThe hostel model thrives in Europe, but will North Americans ever come around? (Photo courtesy of L&L hospitality)\\n\\nWhen I asked why her hostels could snatch some of Airbnb’s market share, Gonzalez gave me a laundry list of reasons. Her properties are affordable, clean (but no cleaning fees!) and run by professional, on-site hosts. Even little things, like being able to leave your luggage after check-out, make hostels more convenient than Airbnbs.\\n\\nThe biggest hurdle, as mentioned, is getting over North Americans’ aversion to the idea of hostels. Yet Gonzalez believes that Airbnb has itself set the stage for this transition, especially among younger travelers.\\n\\n“I’ve realized that Aribnb has actually paved the way for hostels to work in the U.S. by introducing the idea of shared spaces,” she explains. “Because Gen Z was raised with Airbnb, they don’t have the preconceived notions about hostels that older people do.”\\n\\nCompetitive opportunities\\n\\nHostels only challenge part of Airbnb’s business model — the part that attracts low-frills travelers looking for a cheaper alternative to hotels. And legacy hotel brands aren’t ready to go down without a fight. Hilton hotels recently aired a commercial squarely aimed at disgruntled Airbnbers, featuring a creepy vacation rental full of talking dolls, while extolling the reliable virtues of an old-fashioned hotel room.\\n\\nAnd maybe Airbnb needs some disruption of its own. After turning the entire travel industry on its head after launching 15 years ago, the vacation rental behemoth is no longer the young upstart. Maybe a new model is ready to emerge. What happens next depends on what we — the paying guests — decide to do.\\n\\nMore From NerdWallet\\n\\nAir Travelers: Slow Down and Embrace the Long Layover How to Set Financial Boundaries for Holiday Visits Why Booking Travel on Your Phone Is a Bad Idea\\n\\nSam Kemmis writes for NerdWallet.
