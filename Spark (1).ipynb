Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nPercentage Decrease in Stake in Q4: 100%\\n\\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is an American multinational technology corporation that specializes in semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous cars, automation, and artificial intelligence.\\n\\nMotley Fool held 99,991 shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in the third quarter of 2021, worth $5.3 million, representing 0.34% of the total 13F securities. In Q4 2021, Motley Fool discarded its Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stake entirely.\\n\\nOn April 14, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.365 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 1, to shareholders of the company as of May 7. On April 27, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a dividend yield of 3.20%.\\n\\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely on April 13 reiterated a Neutral rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with a $55 price target. The analyst observed that Q1 notebook shipments were down 20% quarter-over-quarter, below Citi\\'s expectation of down 18%, due to ongoing component supply tightness, logistics constraints, and slow Chromebook demand. He views this as \"another yellow flag\" and believes PC sales could \"cool off\" in the second half of 2022 given a reversion to the mean after two consecutive years of double digit growth.\\n\\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 72 hedge funds were bullish on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 66 funds in the third quarter.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\\n\\nHere is what O’Keefe Stevens Advisory has to say about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\\n\\n“Intel announced they are removing stock-based compensation from non-GAAP earnings in 2022 to report results aligning with semiconductor peers. This may seem like a reasonable thing to do as comparability between peers becomes easier. On the other hand, what exactly is the point of adjusted earnings? It is not to conform to some industry norm or because the management teams need to make performance metrics. The point of adjusting earnings is to present results in a light that more closely reflects the actual underlying performance of the business. That is, backing out expenses that might be one-time in nature, such as legal or fire expenses. First off, share-based compensation is an actual expense. Decreasing my ownership stake in a company without receiving any compensation is not free. If a company paid its employees in all stock, would they add back the entire SBC? What a margin profile that would be. Second, should a company be worried about reporting results similar to other companies? Every company is unique. Management should not waste time determining what expenses should be excluded. Run the business, don’t worry about adjusting the numbers.”\\n\\n9. S&P Global Inc.

(NYSE:SPGI) to $475 from $497 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of Q1 results.

The company designs and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers around the world. Motley Fool entirely discarded its $4.3 million Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stake in the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\nOn April 26, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) reported its Q1 results, posting earnings per share of $2.42, beating consensus estimates by $0.22. Revenue for the period grew 14.36% year-over-year to $4.91 billion, surpassing analysts’ predictions by $173.06 million.\\n\\nTruist analyst William Stein lowered the firm\\'s price target on Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) to $172 from $189 and maintained a Hold rating on the shares on April 27.

Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions. This is because online businesses, as well as semiconductor companies, benefit from economies of scale. An online search and advertising engine will, in general, be more profitable per unit of cost as it grows larger in terms of users and advertising dollars. It is a hub-and-spoke model, in other words, where it is generally not necessary to grow expenses at the same rate that revenues grow beyond a certain threshold. Therefore, returns on capital tend to be higher, the larger and more dominant the online search company is.”\\n\\n7. Zoetis Inc.

(NYSE:ZTS) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n“Finally, exiting our position in Zoetis was purely a function of valuation. With the business trading for up to 45x forward earnings, we felt we had more attractive alternatives. We maintain high conviction in the company and their competitive advantages and hope to be owners again, at a more attractive valuation. In short, we sold what we believe to be a high-quality business at relatively high valuations to fund the purchase of equally high-quality businesses trading at lower valuations and even better long-term earnings growth prospects. While we are certainly not tactical in approach, we do aim to make prudent adjustments over time.”\\n\\n6.

Earnings season continues at fever pitch, with last night's update from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms ensuring a positive start to the day. Economic bellwether Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) also reported strong results, but the main event comes later in the day with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Bank of Japan pushed the yen to a 20-year low as it once again refused to act in the face of rising inflation. Sweden's central bank started a long cycle of rate hikes however. The standoff between Europe and Russia over gas deliveries deepened, as Italy's Eni buckled to Kremlin pressure to pay in rubles. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 28th April.\\n\\n1. Omicron set to weigh on U.S. GDP\\n\\nThe U.S. is expected to report a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter, the result of a resurgence of Covid-19 in its new Omicron strain that kept more of the economy locked down for longer than had been expected at the start of the year.\\n\\nThe figures, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), are expected to show growth slowing to an annualized rate of 1.1% from 6.9% in the fourth quarter. If the past is any guide, the figures are likely to be revised upward in subsequent readings, as the traditional data collection methods haven’t adapted completely to changes in working practices during the pandemic.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Labor Department will release the week’s jobless claims numbers. There has been little sign of the tightness in the labor market easing in recent weeks, amid widespread evidence that firms are struggling to hire new workers.\\n\\n2. BoJ drives yen to 20-year low\\n\\nThe Bank of Japan drove the yen to a 20-year low, doubling down on its efforts to keep long-term government bond yields capped well below the rate of inflation.\\n\\nThe BoJ pledged after its routine policy meeting to continue buying unlimited amounts of 10-year government bonds to defend its implicit 0.25% yield cap, signalling its resolve to focus on supporting a fragile economy. The dollar surged 1.3% to break through the 130 yen level for the first time since April 2002.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat also took the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of advanced economy currencies, to within half a percent of a 20-year high. The dollar also continues to gain against emerging currencies: it rose 0.8% against the offshore Chinese yuan to an 18-month high.\\n\\nIt wasn’t all one-way traffic though. The Swedish krona rose across the board as the Riksbank raised its repo rate by 0.25% and flagged a series of rises to come over the next two years. The euro remained under pressure after data suggesting that core inflation remained strong in April.\\n\\n3. Meta set to lift stocks at opening. Apple and Amazon earnings the highlight of a busy day\\n\\nFacebook owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) put the pep back into U.S. stocks with a quarterly report that showed a surprisingly strong increase in users, taken as a sign that its Instagram Reels feature is reasonably capable of competing with the likes of TikTok. Annual revenue growth of 6.6% was still the slowest in its history as a listed company, however. Meta stock was up 16.7% in premarket.\\n\\nAlso performing well in premarket was Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock, up 7.6% after a strong quarterly report for the chipmaker, while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) was up 2.2%.\\n\\nBy 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 283 points, or 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures were up 1.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 2.0%.\\n\\nApple and Amazon round off the earnings season for Big Tech after the bell, with Apple needing to reassure the market that its iPhone production in China won’t be too badly affected by the spate of Covid-19 lockdowns. For Amazon, the focus will be on whether its Cloud business can defend its lead over Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and whether its retail business can cope with surging delivery costs.\\n\\n4. Bellwether Caterpillar beats expectations, inflation theme runs through consumer giants' updates\\n\\nThe earnings storm continues with unabated intensity, with a broad cross-section of companies across the economy reporting.\\n\\nCaterpillar, widely seen as a bellwether for the economy in general, delivered quarterly earnings some 10% above expectations at $2.88 billion, while pharma giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) upgraded its full-year forecast after a strong start to 2022.\\n\\nConsumer giants Altria (NYSE:MO) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) will give important outlooks before the bell, while overnight, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) both warned that input cost inflation is set to get worse before it gets better. Miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) rose after cutting its output forecasts for important battery metals copper and cobalt.\\n\\nSamsung (KS:005930) meanwhile reported its strongest March quarter since 2018.\\n\\n5. EU gas companies buckle under Russian pressure\\n\\nThe face-off between Europe and Russia over energy deliveries intensified, as the European Commission warned EU companies not to comply with Russian demands to pay for their gas in rubles.\\n\\nItalian oil and gas giant Eni is reportedly one of around 10 European buyers of Gazprom’s gas that have applied to open ruble accounts at Gazprombank to satisfy Russia’s demand that they pay in Russian currency rather than in euros or dollars. The EU Commission warned that this would breach existing sanctions on Russia.\\n\\nBenchmark European Natural Gas Futures eased 4.6% to 102.5 euros a megawatt-hour. Analysts have interpreted the spat over gas deliveries as a warning shot to its bigger European customers, Italy and Germany, in what the Kremlin is increasingly styling as an existential war against NATO, rather than a limited operation to ‘liberate’ Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\nPoland dodges flight chaos as controllers reach interim deal\\n\\nBOJ bolsters commitment to ultra-easy policy, triggers yen sell-off\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gdp-apple-amazon-earnings-064632170.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AMZN.US', 'FB.US', 'CAT.US', 'GSPC.INDX', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AMZO34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'CATR.PA', 'AMZ.F', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'AMZN.MX', 'CAT1.XETRA', 'CAT1.F', 'CAT.MX', 'QCOM.US', 'MSFT.US', 'UL.US', 'F.US', 'MO.US', 'MCD.US', 'MRK.US'], 'tags': ['FACEBOOK', 'AMAZON', 'APPLE', 'GDP GROWTH', 'BANK OF JAPAN', 'U.S', 'EARNINGS SEASON', 'RUSSIA', 'META PLATFORMS'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.994, 'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.106}}, {'date': '2022-04-28T06:30:00+00:00', 'title': 'Apple Profits Should Top Estimates, But the Outlook May Disappoint.

Analysts predicted 10.14 trillion won on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung disclosed preliminary numbers earlier this month, including an about 50% increase in operating profit.\\n\\nRevenue at the world’s largest memory chip and smartphone maker rose to a record, boosted by soaring demand for semiconductors that power everything from servers to mobile phones and smart cars. Samsung is benefiting from device manufacturers adopting chips that have bigger storage and better performance, yet concern is rising that consumer spending on personal gadgets is cooling.\\n\\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\\n\\nSouth Korea’s NAND exports stood out in March, reaching a new high. Kioxia’s recent output setbacks may have contributed to the increase in NAND and multi-chip packaging (MCP) exports, suggesting strong sales for Samsung and SK Hynix. Samsung’s foundry business may also benefit from robust system-chip exports.\\n\\n- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI analyst\\n\\nClick here for the full research\\n\\nSamsung’s memory business exceeded the company’s own guidance on bit growth thanks to what it called “solid demand mainly from server and PC.” It said server demand is likely to remain strong, while smartphone demand is projected to rise in the second half of the year after a slight decline in the current quarter.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSupply chain disruptions are worsening because of China’s Covid-related lockdowns, while a war in Ukraine, higher inflation and tighter monetary policy in the U.S. are hurting consumer sentiment. Global smartphone shipments declined 11% in the first quarter, the worst drop since the virus broke out, Canalys data showed. PC shipments declined 6.8%, according to Gartner.\\n\\n“After an increased global shipment of laptops and smartphones in the fourth quarter last year, inventories are rising as actual sales slow down this year,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities in Seoul. “The market’s losing confidence in a recovery of memory demand for the latter half of this year.”\\n\\nSamsung said it benefited from the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Korean won, which outweighed weakness in some emerging currencies. The company estimated that helped boost operating profit by about 300 billion won.\\n\\nIts shares rose just less than 1% in Seoul trading. They had dropped 17% this year through Wednesday’s close.\\n\\nUnlike in the past, when profits were hit hard by fluctuating chip prices, volatility in the current pricing downturn is expected to be less severe this time around. The DRAM industry’s transition to new-generation DDR5 memory and rising NAND prices due to a contamination accident at a rival chipmaker could protect profitability at Samsung, said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment & Securities.\\n\\nSouth Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. said Wednesday that its profit more than doubled in the latest quarter after datacenter sales offset slowing consumer demand and memory prices fell less than was feared. For the rest of the year, Hynix said it expects a bounceback in PC and smartphone sales in the seasonally stronger second half, but that hinges on how long China’s Covid-19 lockdowns continue, which the company said have already affected manufacturing, supply chains and consumer demand.\\n\\nAn additional headache for Samsung is its foundry business, which is grappling with slower-than-expected improvement in production yields at its advanced chipmaking process. Although its foundry sales are rising amid the global chip shortage, investors question Samsung’s capability of manufacturing advanced nodes beyond 4nm. Samsung has set an aggressive goal to start producing 3nm-based chips in the first half of this year, ahead of rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s schedule.\\n\\nWhile Samsung’s pledge to actively pursue mergers and acquisitions has stalled, there’s rising expectations that Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee -- out from prison on parole -- may get back to the office within this year. South Korea’s major business lobby groups sent a joint letter urging President Moon Jae-in to pardon Lee, citing rising risks in the global business environment, according to Yonhap News. The move comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is planning to visit Samsung’s most advanced chip plant in Pyeongtaek during his trip to South Korea in late May.\\n\\nSamsung hired semiconductor investment banker Marco Chisari for a senior role from Bank of America Corp., Bloomberg News reported this week. He had worked at Bank of America since 2018, and had previously worked at Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Mubadala Development Co.\\n\\n(Updates with more details on financial results from sixth paragraph)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China’s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China’s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer Elon Musk Stakes a $44 Billion Claim on the Future of Free Speech\\n\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-profit-beats-estimates-steady-002030546.html', 'symbols': ['JPM.US', 'TSM.US', '000660.KO', 'BAC.US', 'SSNLF.US', 'JPM-PK.US', 'JPM-PL.US', 'JPM-PM.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'TSFA.STU', 'JPM-PC.US', 'GOGL34.SA', 'JPMC34.SA', 'BOAC34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'TSMC34.SA', 'AAPL.US', 'GOOG.US', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'GOGL35.SA', 'GOOGL.US', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'GOOG.MX', 'SSU.STU', 'TSFA.F', 'TSMN.MX', '2330.TW', 'SSUN.STU', 'SMSNN.MX', 'CMC.F', 'CMC.XETRA', 'JPM.MX', 'JPM-PD.US', 'NCB.XETRA', 'BAC.MX', 'BML-PL.US', 'BAC-PE.US', 'BAC-PL.US', 'BAC-PK.US', 'BAC-PB.US', '0Q16.LSE', 'BAC-PQ.US', 'BAC-PS.US'], 'tags': ['BLOOMBERG', 'SOUTH KOREA', 'SAMSUNG', 'FOUNDRY BUSINESS', 'MEMORY CHIPS', 'MEMORY CHIP', 'ELECTRONIC GADGETS', 'SK HYNIX'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.956, 'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.097}}, {'date': '2022-04-28T00:00:15+00:00', 'title': 'Apple Has (Kind of) Opened Up to the Right to Repair', 'content': 'On Wednesday, Apple finally opened the door for customers and independent technicians wanting to perform DIY fixes on iPhones and Mac computers....', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a9f7f29d-c737-37ba-9c76-dcc281e15852/apple-has-%28kind-of%29-opened-up.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA'], 'tags': ['APPLE', 'SILICON VALLEY GIANT', 'INDEPENDENT TECHNICIANS', 'AUTHORIZED SERVICE PROVIDERS'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0, 'neg': 0, 'neu': 1, 'pos': 0}}, {'date': '2022-04-27T22:38:22+00:00', 'title': 'Asian Stocks Up, More Chinese Pledges of Economic Support Boost Sentiment', 'content': \"By Gina Lee\\n\\nInvesting.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning.

The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of widely-regarded market leaders – Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL – while comparing the S&P 500 as well. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nIt’s been a red year for tech. However, it’s been an even tougher stretch for Amazon shares, down nearly 18% and underperforming all names besides Alphabet.\\n\\nOnce we stretch out the time frame to over the past year, the story remains almost the same; AMZN shares have completely broken off from the general market and have been in a downtrend since about the middle of November 2021. Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nSupply-chain issues, rising labor costs, unionization talks, and skyrocketing energy prices have all played spoilsport for AMZN throughout the quarter, and investors are hopeful that a solid earnings release can provide the push needed to shift the tide in their favor. It’s time to analyze key metrics and estimates heading into the e-commerce giant’s quarterly report to see what’s in store.\\n\\nPrevious Share Reactions\\n\\nOver the last five quarterly EPS beats, AMZN shares have moved upward just two times. The most significant upwards price reaction occurred in its latest quarterly report, where the company smoked the consensus EPS estimate by a staggering 613%, no doubt fueling the 4.6% rally that occurred.\\n\\nLooking at what fueled the nearly 5% move from its latest quarterly release, Amazon reported it had benefitted from one of its strongest e-commerce seasons ever paired with extremely high web traffic levels.\\n\\nIf historical data proves accurate, it seems that Amazon will have to beat the quarterly consensus estimate extensively to send shares upward.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nEarnings Surprise Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\n\\nAmazon Web Services\\n\\nA key metric for Amazon heading into its quarterly report is Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue. AWS is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform with millions of customers, including fast-growing startups, large enterprises, and leading government agencies. These customers rely on AWS to lower business costs, become more agile in the cloud, and ramp up innovation.\\n\\nAWS has the deepest functionality within its 200+ services, offering the widest variety of purpose-built databases for various applications. Companies including Meta Platforms FB and Best Buy BBY have recently selected AWS as their preferred cloud provider. Additionally, Nasdaq has shared its multi-year partnership to migrate its markets onto AWS to become the world’s first fully enabled, cloud-based exchange.\\n\\nIt has quickly become the company’s fastest-growing source of revenue, surging nearly 80% year-over-year from 2020 to 2021. Clearly, cloud computing is quickly becoming a critical aspect of technology, and almost all companies would like a piece of the pie. Luckily for Amazon, it has already fully established itself in this area.\\n\\nFor the quarter, net sales for AWS is pegged at $18.5 billion, a 45% increase when compared to the prior quarter’s reported value of $12.7 billion.\\n\\nMicrosoft & Google Cloud\\n\\nThankfully, with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL already releasing their quarterly results, we can dive into how their cloud computing business has performed to understand what to expect from AWS.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s cloud platform revenue paved the way for a robust earnings release. “Continued customer commitment to our cloud platform and strong sales execution drove better than expected commercial booking growth of 28% and Microsoft Cloud revenue of $23.4 billion, up 32% year-over-year,” said Amy Hood, executive VP, and CFO of MSFT.\\n\\nMoving forward, MSFT also believes that digital technology such as the cloud will be a critical growth driver of the world’s economic output.\\n\\nMicrosoft is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an overall VGM Score of a D.\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\\n\\nAlthough GOOGL missed EPS estimates, year-over-year growth in Google Cloud from the year-ago quarter was robust. The company raked in $5.8 billion in revenue from its cloud compared to $4 billion in 2021 Q1, a 44% increase.\\n\\nAdditionally, Google’s cloud revenue grew 47% year-over-year to $19.2 billion from 2020 to 2021 and is forecasted to bring in $26.7 billion for FY22.\\n\\nAlphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A.\\n\\nAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Alphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\\n\\nQ1 EPS & Revenue Forecast\\n\\nThe upcoming quarter’s Consensus Estimate Trend has retraced marginally down to $8.73 per share over the last 60 days, with two analysts downwardly revising their estimates. With tough year-over-year comparisons from the year-ago quarter, quarterly earnings are forecasted to decrease by a notable 45%.\\n\\nWith COVID-19 fleeting, it’s no surprise to me that earnings are forecasted to decline; many people are returning to the outside world and are no longer forced to shop online, drastically affecting web traffic levels.\\n\\nRevenue for the upcoming quarter is pegged at $117 billion, a solid 8% increase from the previous year’s quarter. However, the $117 billion estimate reflects a 15% decrease in sales from the prior quarter.\\n\\nOnce again, it’s not surprising to see quarterly revenue decline from the previous quarter’s value; AMZN benefitted greatly during the holiday season when web traffic was at an extremely high level.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nThe market is sailing in rough waters at the moment, and Amazon has some very tough year-over-year comparisons to compete with. However, there are bright spots, such as the robust demand for AWS, a critical metric that will no doubt benefit Amazon in the long term as the world rapidly adopts cloud computing.\\n\\nAdditionally, in a shareholder-friendly move, Amazon announced a 20-for-1 stock split back in early March, which will significantly lower the barrier of entry for potential investors and provide ease for the stock price to once again multiply and provide considerable gains. Trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 6th.\\n\\nThe entire market will no doubt be watching the company’s quarterly earnings like a hawk, and for a good reason – a better-than-expected earnings release could be the fuel needed to send AMZN shares back into an uptrend.\\n\\nHeading into the report, I believe that investors should heed caution due to the current nature of the market and should instead wait to see if buyers step up. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B.\\n\\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Amazon.com, Inc.

Analysts had estimated 1.94 billion.\\n\\nRevenue for the period jumped 6.6% to $27.9 billion, and would have been higher if not for the war in Ukraine, the company said. The stock had dropped almost 50% this year as investors became increasingly worried that Meta’s main business and profit engine -- advertising in its social media feeds -- was losing steam.\\n\\nThose concerns appear to have been put to rest -- at least for now -- given Facebook added 31 million new daily active users in the recent quarter. Still, many of Meta’s challenges remain. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that video-sharing app TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., is providing serious competition for young users’ attention.\\n\\nMeanwhile, changes to data-collection rules on Apple Inc.’s iPhones have hindered Meta’s ability to serve users targeted ads. Last quarter, Meta executives said the privacy changes would reduce the company’s 2022 sales by $10 billion. Advertisers have also been spending less due to issues with supply chains, inflation and the ongoing war in Ukraine, Meta executives said.\\n\\nA prolonged slowdown would make it tougher for the company to justify Zuckerberg’s expensive, virtual-reality-fueled vision of the metaverse, a business that won’t bring in profit for years -- if ever. Meta said that in light of the revenue outlook, it is paring its spending plans for the year, to $87 billion to $92 billion from a previous target of as much as $95 billion.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nSales in the current period will be $28 billion to $30 billion, Meta said Wednesday in a statement, compared with the $30.7 billion analysts had predicted on average. Again, the company pointed to the ongoing war in Ukraine as a factor.\\n\\n“This outlook reflects a continuation of the trends impacting revenue growth in the first quarter, including softness in the back half of the first quarter that coincided with the war in Ukraine,” the company said in the statement.\\n\\nNet income in the first quarter was $7.47 billion, or $2.72 a share. Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.56 per share.\\n\\nShares of Menlo Park, California-based Meta climbed as high as $204.55 in extended trading following the report. They had slipped 3.3% to $174.95 at Wednesday’s close in New York.\\n\\nThe company in the holiday quarter reported that daily users for its core Facebook service declined slightly for the first time ever, raising the possibility that the main social network had peaked in popularity.\\n\\nIn October, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would focus on attracting “young people” to the service as a way to combat the rise of TikTok and other competing products. That means prioritizing Reels, a copycat video format on Meta-owned Instagram and Facebook. While usage of Reels is growing quickly, the company’s advertisers haven’t been as fast to switch to the new format.\\n\\n(Updates to add spending forecast in sixth paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China’s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China’s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy Elon Musk Stakes a $44 Billion Claim on the Future of Free Speech We’re Fighting Covid With Faulty Data\\n\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-shares-soar-facebook-returns-202015130.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'FB.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'FBOK34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', 'FB.MX', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'FB2A.XETRA', 'FB2A.F'], 'tags': ['FACEBOOK', 'BLOOMBERG', 'MARK ZUCKERBERG', 'SOCIAL NETWORK', 'WAR IN UKRAINE'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.665, 'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.077}}, {'date': '2022-04-27T20:55:49+00:00', 'title': 'Qualcomm Gains After Chipmaker Gives Upbeat Sales Forecast', 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of chips that run smartphones, surged in late trading after giving a strong sales forecast for the current quarter, bolstered by its expansion into new markets.\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\n\\nFour European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Russia to Cut Gas to Poland and Bulgaria, Making Energy a Weapon Russia to Cut Gas to Poland, Bulgaria Until Pay Demands Met Amazon’s Twitch Seeks to Revamp Creator Pay With Focus on Profit Ukraine Latest: Russia Says It Cut Gas Flows to Poland, Bulgaria\\n\\nRevenue will be $10.5 billion to $11.3 billion in the fiscal third quarter, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $9.97 billion. Profit will be $2.75 to $2.95 a share, well above the $2.60 average projection.\\n\\nThe outlook helped dispel fears that chip demand is slowing after a pandemic-fueled surge the past two years -- and showed that Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon’s long-touted plan to diversity the business is paying off.\\n\\nQualcomm’s main product is the processor that runs many of the world’s smartphones, and another of its chips connects Apple Inc.’s iPhone to high-speed data networks. That makes it particularly vulnerable to swings in demand for such devices. But under Amon, the company is trying to parlay that skill set into a growing presence in cars, networking and computers.\\n\\nQualcomm shares, which had slid this year in line with a general decline in chip stocks, rose as much as 7.3% in extended trading following the announcement. They closed at $135.10 in New York trading on Wednesday.\\n\\nAnalysts have pointed to slowing demand for Android phones in China, the largest market, as a threat to growth. But sales of Qualcomm’s phone-related chips were higher than expected last quarter. They came in at $6.33 billion, compared with an estimate of $5.99 billion.\\n\\nThe company predicted its handset division will grow more than 50% in its current fiscal year, bolstered by Samsung Electronics Co.’s flagship Galaxy phone and gains at some Chinese smartphone makers. Previous versions of the Galaxy line had used a larger proportion of Samsung’s own chips, rather than Qualcomm’s.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRevenue from the Internet of Things -- efforts to add computing power to a wider range of devices and appliances -- was $1.7 billion. That compared with an average projection of $1.6 billion.\\n\\nIncreasing use of its chips in industrial machinery is driving growth as well, Qualcomm said. The company’s automotive unit, which posted sales of $339 million, was up 41% from a year earlier. It has a “design-win pipeline” that will amount to more than $16 billion of sales, Qualcomm said.\\n\\nExcluding certain items, profit in the fiscal second quarter was $3.21 a share, compared with Wall Street’s average estimate of $2.93. The company generated $11.2 billion in revenue, topping the $10.6 billion projection.\\n\\nLike many other chipmakers, Qualcomm outsources its production and has struggled to get enough supply from its Asian subcontractors over the last two years. The company’s leaders have promised it will be able to strike a better balance between supply and demand as 2022 progresses.\\n\\nIn prior quarters, Qualcomm has focused on providing the most expensive smartphone parts -- at the expense of orders from makers of cheaper smartphones. But Amon’s longer-term strategy is betting on new markets. He has said that his tenure should be judged by Qualcomm’s progress in higher-growth areas.\\n\\nQualcomm had set aggressive growth goals. Revenue has the potential to top $46 billion by fiscal 2024, Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said at a company event late last year.\\n\\nThe company is unusual in the chip industry because a large chunk of its profit comes from technology licensing. Makers of phones pay to use Qualcomm’s technology, regardless of whether they buy its chips, because the company owns patents that cover some of the fundamentals of mobile communications.\\n\\n(Updates with details of divisional performance starting in seventh paragraph.)\\n\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\n\\nThe 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China’s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China’s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy Elon Musk Stakes a $44 Billion Claim on the Future of Free Speech We’re Fighting Covid With Faulty Data\\n\\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-gains-chipmaker-gives-upbeat-201158010.html', 'symbols': ['AAPL.US', 'QCOM.US', 'SSNLF.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'QCI.XETRA', 'AAPL.MX', 'SSUN.F', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'SSU.STU', 'SSUN.STU', 'SSU.F', 'SMSNN.MX', '005935.KO', '005930.KO', 'QCI.F', 'QCOM.MX'], 'tags': ['BLOOMBERG', 'QUALCOMM', 'SMARTPHONES'], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.966, 'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.084}}, {'date': '2022-04-27T20:50:09+00:00', 'title': \"Meta earnings: 'Facebook is in a pitstop,' analyst says\", 'content': \"Jefferies Equity Research Analyst Brent Thill joins Yahoo Finance Live to look at Meta's shares jump amid its Q1 earnings beat and revenue miss, users growth, advertising monetization, Q2 outlook, and opportunities in social media trends.\", 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/video/meta-earnings-facebook-pitstop-analyst-205009654.html', 'symbols': ['TWTR.US', 'AAPL.US', 'FB.US', 'MSFT.US', 'SNAP.US', 'GOOGL.US', 'GOOG.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'GOOG.MI', 'FBOK34.SA', 'MSFT.MX', 'TWTR.MX', 'GOGL34.SA', 'AAPL.MX', '1SI.F', 'FB.MX', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'MSFT34.SA', 'MSF.XETRA', 'MSF.F', 'GOGL35.SA', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'GOOG.MX', 'FB2A.XETRA', 'FB2A.F', '1SI.XETRA', 'TWTR34.SA', 'TWR.XETRA', 'TWR.F'], 'tags': [], 'sentiment': {'polarity': 0.7, 'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.18}}, {'date': '2022-04-27T20:34:00+00:00', 'title': 'Facebook earnings beat sends Meta stock soaring, but sales hit slowest growth in a decade', 'content': 'Facebook Meta Platforms Inc. is the latest tech giant to feel an economic pinch.

Disney’s doing it. HBO did it. I don’t think we have a lot of doubt that it works. All those companies have figured it out. I’m sure we’ll just get in and figure it out as opposed to just test it and maybe do it or not do it.\"\\n\\nAd-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) \"has proven itself to a point that it both makes economical sense and is also accepted by consumers,\" Gangwar said, explaining that Netflix likely will \"slow down the subscription losses and start growing again pretty fast\" due to the new offering.\\n\\nHe added, \"It gives consumers choice. Choice is always good.\"\\n\\nAccording to The Trade Desk\\'s latest Future of TV report, which surveyed 150 TV advertising planning and buying decision makers with annual ad budgets of $5+ million, more U.S. viewers report watching streaming content with ads (44%) than without (33%).\\n\\nThe survey added that nearly two-thirds of U.S. viewers (64%) don’t want to spend more than $30 in total per month on streaming services, making free or lower-cost ad-supported services more attractive to consumers. Netflix is entering the ad-supported space. According to The Trade Desk\\'s latest \\'Future of TV\\' survey, more U.S. viewers report watching streaming content with ads (44%) than without (33%)\\n\\nLooking ahead, Gangwar noted that Netflix is in a positive position as it does not rely on advertising in the same ways as traditional media players, which are beholden to a particular legacy structure, like the 30-second ad spot.\\n\\n\"Netflix has a flattened slate,\" the executive revealed, underscoring that the platform has the power to experiment and change the entire ad ecosystem for the better.\\n\\n\"Netflix can say, \\'How do I create the best consumer experience?\\' If that\\'s a 30 second ad, great. But if it\\'s not, they can be creative and let data drive their choices,\" Gangwar explained, adding that he sees a more curated experience in which users are shown certain ads depending on their profile and preferences.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the table stakes. You have to not only cater the ad to the advertiser, but you also have to cater it to the consumer based on their interests,\" he continued.\\n\\nData has been an increasingly important element to streamers that are looking to deepen their connections with subscribers, thus making an interactive, ad-supported experience a win-win in terms of customer retention and information.\\n\\n\"The content experience and the ad experience can feed on each other,\" Gangwar said, predicting that users will see more interactive ads and experimentation within the space overall.\\n\\n\"Netflix will force all of the streaming services to make things better than they are today,\" he concluded.\\n\\nAlexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Self Service Repair is available in the US and will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — later this year.\\n\\nThe new online store offers more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices to complete repairs on the iPhone® 12 and iPhone 13 lineups and iPhone SE (3rd generation), such as the display, battery, and camera. Later this year the program will also include manuals, parts, and tools to perform repairs on Mac® computers with Apple silicon.\\n\\nTo start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visiting support.apple.com/self-service-repair. Then, they can visit the Apple Self Service Repair Store and order the necessary parts and tools.\\n\\nEvery genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. The parts are the same ones — at the same price — as those available to Apple’s network of authorized repair providers. For certain repairs, customers will receive a credit when returning a replaced part for recycling.\\n\\nThe Apple tools available to customers on the Self Service Repair Store are the same as used by Apple’s repair network. They are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. The high-quality tools offered through Self Service Repair include torque drivers, repair trays, display and battery presses, and more.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nApple will offer tool rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. The weeklong rental kits will ship to customers for free.\\n\\nSelf Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.\\n\\nOver the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 3,000 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, in the US, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 20 minutes of an authorized service provider.\\n\\nAlso today, Apple published a paper, \"Expanding Access to Safe, Reliable, and Secure Service and Repair,\" which details Apple’s approach to designing long-lasting products and increasing access to repairs.\\n\\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

KR as the Bull of the Day and The Boston Beer Company, Inc. SAM\\xa0as\\xa0the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on\\xa0Apple AAPL, Camtek CAMT and CDW CDW.\\n\\nHere is a synopsis of all five\\xa0stocks:\\n\\nBull\\xa0of\\xa0the\\xa0Day:\\n\\nThe Kroger Co. stock soared to new highs after it posted strong fourth quarter results in early March and offered solid guidance as it adapts to supply chain bottlenecks and rising prices.\\n\\nThe grocery chain powerhouse thrived during the heart of the pandemic and now Kroger is benefitting from price-conscious shoppers trying to eat out less amid 40-year high inflation. KR\\'s digital and e-commerce efforts are poised to continue to drive growth. And Wall Street might be set to keep buying Kroger during the current market and economic turmoil for its stability, dividend, and more.\\n\\nNever Going Out of Style\\n\\nKroger is the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. and one of the biggest in the world. KR operates under multiple brands across roughly 35 states, with over 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department store locations. Many of Kroger\\'s stores feature pharmacies and gas stations.\\n\\nBrick and mortar is fading within some aspects of retail, but it continues to thrive in the grocery and supermarket segment. Kroger has, of course, spent the last several years working to improve and beef up its e-commerce business, like nearly everyone else in the retail industry. These efforts include expanded online pickup and delivery offerings.\\n\\nKroger is actively building out its network of high-tech warehouses/fulfillment centers. The company also operates dozens of food production or manufacturing facilities to help produce its own private-label products that provide value for customers and help boost margins.\\n\\nRecent Results & Outlook\\n\\nShopping patterns benefited Kroger and others such as Target during the pandemic, as consumers avoided eating out and tried to have plenty of food stocked up. KR\\'s 2020 sales climbed over 8%. Even as people returned to their more normal lives, groceries are still a staple that are never going out of style.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAs the pandemic faded, Kroger then benefitted from risings costs across the economy that spurred many shoppers to cook and eat at home more often. KR\\'s 2021 revenue popped 4% to $138 billion, with its digital sales up 113% on a two-year stack. The company has been able to pass its higher costs onto consumers as well, with its adjusted earnings up 6% last year.\\n\\nThe Cincinnati-based chain\\'s same-stores sales popped 4% in Q4, with it up 15% vs. its fourth quarter 2019 levels. KR\\'s adjusted fourth quarter earnings popped over 12% to help it blow away the Zacks consensus EPS by 25%. The big bottom-line beat is part of a 22% average outperformance in the trailing four quarters.\\n\\nCrucially, Kroger upped its 2022 guidance as it sees customers flocking to its stores. KR is poised to keep successfully navigating rising costs across the entire supply chain, while methodically and strategically raising its prices.\\n\\nKroger\\'s FY22 consensus earnings estimate has soared 10% since its report, with FY23\\'s 11.3% higher. Shoppers are gravitating toward its higher-margin and lower-priced store brands, while upping their engagement with coupons. Luckily, KR executives said they see inflation moderating in the second-half of 2022.\\n\\nKroger faces tough-to-compete against years. Still, Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb 2.4% both this year and next to reach $144.5 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to pop 2% in 2022 and 5% in 2023.\\n\\nEfforts & Other Fundamentals\\n\\nKroger is actively raising its wages to help compete for talent alongside Target, Amazon, Walmart, and many others. KR is also upping its efforts to fight against food waste and hunger, while actively attempting to improve quality and address issues such as animal treatment within its supply chains. These might raise costs, but they will likely help improve the company over the long haul.\\n\\nWall Street can get behind these broader goals because KR is actively boosting its dividend and buying back stock. Its current $0.21 a share quarterly payout is up 17% YoY. The company has now raised its dividend for 15 years in a row and plans to \"deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time,\" while also deploying its free cash flow to other efforts.\\n\\nKroger\\'s dividend (next payable on June 1, ex-dividend May 12) yield sits at 1.50% to top its industry and Walmart\\'s 1.41% and match Target. Some of these fundamentals are what attracted Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Kroger back in the fourth quarter of 2019. And KR\\'s valuation, which we will touch on next, is enticing.\\n\\nPrice & Valuation\\n\\nKroger shares have rather easily outpaced its highly-ranked Retail-Supermarkets industry over the decade, up 475% vs. 218% (this also tops the S&P 500\\'s 345%). This includes a downward stretch, but KR has now ripped off a 135% surge in the last three years. Wall Street has jumped heavily into the stock in the last six months as the tech trade fades and investors clamor for value and dividends.\\n\\nKR has climbed 45% in the last six months vs. its industry\\'s 10% pop and the market\\'s 6% drop. This includes a big post-earnings release jump that sent it to brand new highs in early March. Kroger inched higher after that run and now trades about 10% below its recent highs at roughly $56 a share.\\n\\nKroger currently trades at 14.9X forward 12-month earnings. This marks a30% discount to the Retail-Supermarkets industry and 31% value vs. the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale Sector. On top of that, Kroger trades 24% beneath its own highs and not too far above its median over the last decade.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nKroger\\'s improved bottom-line outlook helps it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It seems like a solid candidate to buy both during the current market conditions and as a longer-term retail play because people will never stop needing full-service supermarkets. And during these times, keeping it simple might be the most thoughtful option.\\n\\nBear\\xa0of the Day:\\n\\nThe hard seltzer boom helped The Boston Beer Company, Inc. go on a massive run from the middle of 2017 until April 2021. Wall Street poured into the stock as its Truly hard seltzer brand flew off the shelves, helping drive double-digit revenue growth.\\n\\nBoston Beer was never going to be able to keep up its hyperbolic run and SAM shares have tumbled over the last 12 months as Truly\\'s growth slows to more reasonable levels amid increased competition.\\n\\nSAM Basics\\n\\nBoston Beer helped kick start the craft beer revolution in the U.S. decades ago. Years later, it was at the forefront of the biggest thing since light beer. SAM launched Truly Hard Seltzer in 2016 and it became one of two dominant players in the category, alongside White Claw, right out of the gate.\\n\\nBoston Beer\\'s revenue surged 15% in fiscal 2018, 26% in FY19, 39% in 2020, and another 19% last year. The past four years marked SAM\\'s strongest top-line growth since 2014. In fact, Boston Beer had never posted 30% or stronger revenue growth since it went public in the late 1990s until 2020.\\n\\nVictim of Its Own Success?\\n\\nBoston\\'s first-to-market advantages have slowly faded a bit as nearly every alcoholic beverage giant joined the party. Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors, Constellation Brands, and even Coca-Cola, under its Topo Chico brand, are now players in the hard seltzer market. These companies have rolled out offerings under Bud Light, Corona, and other brands. At the same time, many smaller players are entering the market constantly.\\n\\nBoston Beer has fallen way short of our Zacks earnings estimates in the trailing four periods. This includes a massive first quarter fiscal 2022 miss when it reported on April 21. The company reported an adjusted loss of -$0.16 per share vs. the Zacks consensus that called for +$2.05 a share on lower-than-projected revenue. The first quarter marked its second-consecutive adjusted loss.\\n\\nBoston Beer is coming up against very tough to compete against years, with its Q1 revenue down 21% after its fourth quarter 2021 sales slipped 25%. The company\\'s gross margin also fell from 45.8% in the year-ago quarter to 40.2%.\\n\\nZacks estimates call for Boston Beer\\'s revenue to climb another 9% in 2022 to $2.25 billion and 6% higher in FY23. This is highly impressive considering the run it just went on. The company\\'s adjusted earnings are, however, projected to slip 20% YoY in 2022. And its FY22 and FY23 consensus estimates have dipped since its recent release.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nBoston Beer\\'s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now, and its Beverages – Alcohol space is in the bottom third of over 250 Zacks industries. SAM shares have fallen 21% in the last two years and 70% from its records.\\n\\nBoston Beer operates a solid business that\\'s continuing to grow. The firm is even rolling out new Truly drinks to get into the \"high-end of the hard seltzer category.\" And we have hardly even mentioned its beer business. Therefore, it is likely the stock will start to make a comeback some time, but it might not be the best time to dive into SAM given the current market turmoil.\\n\\nAdditional content:\\n\\nWhat to Expect from Apple\\'s (AAPL) Q2 Earnings Report?\\n\\nApple is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Apr 28.\\n\\nApple did not provide revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, given the uncertainty around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The company expects to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a second-quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which it estimates to be less than the December quarter.\\n\\nHowever, Apple expects revenue growth rate to decelerate from the December quarter, primarily due to tough year-over-year comparisons and unfavorable forex.\\n\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $94.79 billion, indicating growth of 5.82% from the year-ago quarter\\'s reported figure.\\n\\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.43 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and indicating 2.14% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nApple\\'s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and was in line with the remaining one, the earnings surprise being 20.28%, on average.\\n\\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\\n\\nLet\\'s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.\\n\\nStrong iPhone 13 Demand to Drive Y/Y Sales Growth\\n\\nApple\\'s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 57.8% of net sales in the last-reported quarter, wherein sales increased 9.2% year over year to $71.63 billion.\\n\\nContinued demand for the 5G-enabled iPhone 13 is expected to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Per a latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple grabbed the #2 spot with 18% of market share in first-quarter 2022.\\n\\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for iPhone sales currently stands at $48.68 billion, indicating 1.2% growth from the year-ago quarter\\'s reported figure.\\n\\nServices Momentum to Aid Q2 Top-Line Growth\\n\\nThe Services segment is riding on increasing popularity of the App Store. Apple currently has more than 785 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.\\n\\nServices like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.\\n\\nApple TV+ is gaining recognition, with Ted Lasso winning multiple Emmy Awards and, most recently, CODA winning three Academy Awards.\\n\\nDuring the to-be-reported quarter, Apple TV+ gained the rights to stream weekly Major League Baseball games, including two Friday night games.\\n\\nApple expects Services\\' growth rate to decline as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Markedly, in the previous quarter, Services revenues grew 23.8% from the year-ago quarter to $19.52 billion and accounted for 15.7% of sales.\\n\\nWearables\\' Growth to Remain Strong\\n\\nApple is dominating the wearables market, thanks to strong adoption of Apple Watch. The company\\'s Fitness+ subscription service, built on Apple Watch, is a game changer. Fitness+ tracks health- and workout-related data from Apple Watch that users can view on their iPhones, iPads or Apple TVs.\\n\\nThe addition of healthcare features has been a game-changer for Apple Watch. The Series 7 model offers Blood Oxygen app, ECG app, high and low heart rate notifications, irregular heart rhythm notification and fall detection.\\n\\nApple Watch\\'s adoption rate continues to grow rapidly. More than two-thirds of the customers who purchased Apple Watch during first-quarter fiscal 2022 were first-time customers.\\n\\nDuring the to-be-reported quarter, Apple released watchOS 8.5 to all Watch users, starting with the Series 3 models. The latest update adds 37 new emojis and offers a new, non-binary Siri voice for American users.\\n\\nApple Watch users can now authorize Apple TV purchases and subscriptions, a feature provided by the latest watchOS 8.5 update.\\n\\nApple is offering updates to irregular rhythm notifications designed to improve atrial fibrillation identification. This feature is available in the United States, Chile, Hong Kong, South Africa and many other regions.\\n\\nWhat Our Model Says\\n\\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that\\'s not the case here.\\n\\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -0.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\\'re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\\n\\nStocks to Consider\\n\\nHere are a couple companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases:\\n\\nCamtek has an Earnings ESP of +1.73% and is Zacks #2 Ranked.
